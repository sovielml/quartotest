## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
from gradio_client import Client

client = Client("https://fffiloni-image-to-story.hf.space/")
result = client.predict(
				"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradio-app/gradio/main/test/test_files/bus.png",	# str (filepath or URL to image) in 'Image input' Image component
				"Children",	# str in 'Target Audience' Radio component
				fn_index=1
)
print(result)
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=2}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
